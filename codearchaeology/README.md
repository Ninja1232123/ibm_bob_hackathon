# CodeArchaeology - Dig Through Your Code's History

Uncover the hidden stories in your codebase. Understand how your code evolved, discover patterns, find hotspots, and learn from the past.

## 🏛️ The Problem

Your codebase has a history, but it's buried in thousands of commits:
- Which code is fragile and changes constantly?
- What experiments were tried and abandoned?
- How did critical functions evolve?
- Where are the knowledge hotspots?
- What patterns emerge over time?

Traditional tools show **what changed**. CodeArchaeology reveals **why** and **how** it evolved.

## 🔍 What CodeArchaeology Does

### Discover Code Hotspots
```bash
codearch hotspots

# Output:
Top 10 Most Changed Files:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. src/auth/login.py        89 changes  ⚠️  HIGH RISK
2. src/api/routes.py         67 changes  ⚠️  HIGH RISK
3. src/models/user.py        45 changes  🔶 MODERATE

Hotspot Analysis:
- auth/login.py has been modified every week for 3 months
- Indicates: Complex logic or frequent bugs
- Last major refactor: 2 weeks ago
```

### Track Code Lineage
```bash
codearch lineage src/auth/login.py:authenticate

# Shows complete evolution of a function:
authenticate() Evolution Timeline:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2024-08-15: Initial implementation (simple password check)
2024-09-03: Added JWT token generation
2024-09-10: Added refresh token logic
2024-09-15: REVERTED - token bug
2024-09-16: Re-implemented with fix
2024-10-01: Added 2FA support
2024-11-01: Complete refactor (current)

Complexity Trend: Simple → Complex → Simplified
Stability: Unstable (3 reverts) → Stable (no changes 1mo)
```

### Find Abandoned Code
```bash
codearch abandoned

# Discover dead experiments:
Potentially Abandoned Code:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
src/experimental/new_cache.py
  - Last modified: 6 months ago
  - Created with 5 commits in 1 week
  - Then abandoned (no changes since)
  - Never referenced in production code
  - Recommendation: Archive or remove

src/utils/old_parser.py
  - Replaced by new_parser.py 3 months ago
  - Still in codebase but unused
  - Recommendation: Safe to delete
```

### Analyze Patterns
```bash
codearch patterns

# Uncover development patterns:
Bug Fix Patterns:
- Authentication bugs: Peak on Monday mornings
- Database errors: Increase after schema changes
- API errors: Correlate with new feature releases

Refactoring Patterns:
- Large refactors happen every 2-3 months
- Pre-refactor: 2 week spike in bug fixes
- Post-refactor: 40% reduction in changes

Developer Patterns:
- Alice: Focuses on new features (75% feature commits)
- Bob: Focuses on bugs (60% bugfix commits)
- Team: Refactors together (pair programming detected)
```

### Visualize Evolution
```bash
codearch visualize src/auth/

# Creates visual timeline:
Authentication Module Evolution (12 months)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Aug  ████░░░░  Initial implementation
Sep  ██████░░  Rapid feature additions
Oct  ████████  Peak complexity (bug fixes)
Nov  ███░░░░░  Stabilization
Dec  ██░░░░░░  Maintenance only
Jan  ███░░░░░  Minor updates
Feb  ████████  Major refactor
Mar  ██░░░░░░  Stable
```
